# ColorPalette

##### This is just a mini project that i did to learn the basics of Python Imaging Library, Pandas, Numpy and the K-Means Clustering Algorithm. I also did this because I am intigued by filmography. I knew this existed and wanted to figure out how it's done. And so I researched and wrote this code. I tried to make it as simple as possible for beginners to understand.

## How to use :
##### You must have Python installed on your system for this to run.
#### 1. Navigate in your command line to the working directory
#### 2. Run the command "pip install -r requirements.txt" to install the needed packages.
#### 3. Bring any image to your working directory.
#### 4. Run the code by typing "python code.py"
#### 5. Enter the name of the picture/image file.
#### 6. Wait for a few seconds (depends on your system) and a Matplotlib window will show you the palette.
#### 7. Finally close the window and check the project folder. A new file will be created named "ColorPalette.png".
